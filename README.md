大家好，这是Rainer Grimm的作品，Boolan的吴咏炜老师 杨文波老师一起全力翻译的作品，随书对应的源码，
这本书有些类似于《Effective C++》的感觉，给了很多实用的黄金玉律，欢迎大家一起交流呀！

# C++ Core Guidelines: Best Practices for Modern C++
This is the code repository for my book [C++ Core Guidelines: Best Practices for Modern C++](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Grimm-C-Core-Guidelines-Explained-Best-Practices-for-Modern-C/PGM2928303.html)
I put the name of the source file in the title of each source code example in the book. 
## Description
C++ expert instructor Rainer Grimm offers accessible, practical coverage of the Core Guidelines that offer the most value to students learning the C++ programming language. Offering new insights, indispensable context, and proven C++17 examples drawn from his courses and seminars, Grimm helps students get more value from the guidelines. 

Grimm’s wide-ranging coverage addresses C++ programming philosophy, interfaces, functions, classes, class hierarchies, enumerations, resource management, expressions, statements, performance, concurrency, error handling, constants, immutability, templates, generic programming, C-style programming, source files, the Standard Library, and more. Each section links to the original standard online, and wherever appropriate, Grimm previews advances from C++20 and C++23. With Grimm's Help, students can use the C++ Core Guidelines to write C++ code that's more consistent, robust, and well-performing.
